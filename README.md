# sGlobe package

Welcome to the sGlobe package. This package contains a dataset with biomass production data, collected in 147 temperate grasslands plots, grouped in 10 sites.

The package contains a dataframe (dat) for you to play with. It contains dry matter (DM) of standing biomass, plot and site information (Plot, Site), species richness (SR), loam content (Loam), soil pH (pH), soil phosphorous content (P), soil carbon content (C), cover (Cover) and height (Height) of the vegetation.

Install this R package and:
1. Use the built-in dataframe and the lme4 package to fit a mixed model (with random intercept) of the dry matter as a function of species richness, vegetation height and their interaction. Gaussian distribution is ok.
2. Report the p-value of the interaction and the marginal RÂ² to Koenraad via Whatsapp
